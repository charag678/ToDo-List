## Testing Guidance üìù

1.  **Adding a Task**: Type the task you want to add into the input field. Press Enter or click the "Add" button.
   
2.  **Sorting a Task**: The following steps are:

     i). **Ascending Sorting:**
    
      - Add multiple tasks with different text or timestamps.
      - Click on the sorting button/icon to trigger ascending sorting.
      - Verify that tasks are sorted alphabetically or chronologically from oldest to newest.

     ii). **Descending Sorting:**
    
      - Add multiple tasks with different text or timestamps.
      - Click on the sorting button/icon to trigger descending sorting.
      - Verify that tasks are sorted alphabetically or chronologically from newest to oldest.

 4.  **Filtering a Task:**

     - Add a mix of completed and incomplete tasks.
     - Click on the filter button/icon to toggle filtering.
     - Verify that only completed or incomplete tasks are displayed based on the filter state.
     
5.  **Removing a Task**: Completed tasks can be remove individually by clicking the remove button next to each task or all at once by clicking the "Clear All" button.
6.  **Marking a Task as Completed**: Click on the checkbox icon next to a task to mark it as completed. The task will be visually struck through to indicate its completion.
